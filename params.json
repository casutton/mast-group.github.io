{"name":"Mast-group.GitHub.io","tagline":"Machine Learning for the Analysis of Source Code Text","body":"### Who we are\r\nWe are a group of researchers at Edinburgh University's School of Informatics interested in Machine learning techniques for the Analysis of Source code Text (MAST). To get an idea of our research interests, take a look at our [reading group](https://wiki.inf.ed.ac.uk/ANC/MAST).\r\n\r\n### What we do\r\nAs part of our research we strive to create useful tools that leverage machine learning to aid source code developers. In particular, we have developed the following tools:\r\n\r\n##### Naturalize\r\nNaturalize is a language agnostic framework for learning coding conventions from a codebase and then expoiting this information for suggesting better identifier names and formatting changes in the code.\r\nWebsite: http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/naturalize/\r\nCode: https://github.com/mast-group/naturalize\r\nPaper: [Learning natural coding conventions](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2635883). M. Allamanis, E. T. Barr, C. Bird and C. Sutton. FSE 2014.\r\n\r\n##### TASSAL\r\nTASSAL is a tool for the automatic summarization of source code using autofolding. Autofolding automatically creates a summary of a source code file by folding non-essential code and comment blocks.\r\nCode: https://github.com/mast-group/tassal\r\nPaper: [Autofolding for Source Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.4503). J. Fowkes, R. Ranca, M. Allamanis, M. Lapata and C. Sutton. arXiv preprint 1403.4503, 2014.\r\n\r\n### Group Members\r\n[Miltos Allamanis](http://miltos.allamanis.com/) (@mallamanis) \r\nis a PhD student and a Microsoft Research PhD Scholar at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Charles Sutton. He is pursuing a PhD on Statistical Natural Language Processing for Programming Language Text.\r\n\r\n[Jaroslav Fowkes](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jfowkes/) (@jfowkes)\r\nis a Postdoc at the University of Edinburgh and member of the machine learning group. His research focuses on developing natural language processing techniques for the analysis of program source code text as well as novel statistical methods for exploratory data analysis.  \r\n\r\n[Charles Sutton](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/) (@casutton)\r\nis a Reader (= US Associate Professor) at the University of Edinburgh and member of the machine learning group. His research aims at new statistical machine learning methods designed to handle data about the operation and performance of large-scale computer systems with ultimate goal to improve techniques for developing, managing, and debugging computer systems.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
